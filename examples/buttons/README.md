# Buttons Example

This example demonstrates:
* How parent and child components are supported.
* How styles are de-duplicated for multiple instances of the same element.
* How using the complete set of CSS is possible, i.e. active/disabled/focus/hover pseudo selectors.
* How component styles can be added to and overriden.
